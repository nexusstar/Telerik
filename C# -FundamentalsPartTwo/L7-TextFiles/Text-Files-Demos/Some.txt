Something you said made me lose it again;
I can't remember the last time you made me feel safe.
There's no room for love, no time for understanding;
Sometimes I start a fight just to see if you care.

It's not getting better;
It's not getting any easier.
I never thought I'd become so cold inside.

Day after day, we're wishing our lives would change;
As long as you say it's alright, it's alright with me.
If we promise too much; more than enough.
I never thought it'd be easy; not hard like this.

It's not getting better;
It's not getting any easier.
I never thought I'd become so cold inside.

It's not getting better;
It's not getting any easier.
I never thought I'd become so cold inside.

I never thought it'd be easy; not hard like this.
I never thought it'd be easy; not hard like this.
I never thought it'd be easy; not hard like this.
I never thought it'd be easy; not hard like this.
I never thought it'd be easy.
