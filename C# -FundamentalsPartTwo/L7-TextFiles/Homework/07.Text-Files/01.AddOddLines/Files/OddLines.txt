I was mulling over this
tricky issue when
I visited Kent Beck in Zurich. 
Perhaps he was 
under the influence of the odors of his newborn daughter at the time,
but he had come up 
with the notion describing the "when" of refactoring in terms of smells. 
"Smells," you say,
"and that is supposed to be better than vague aesthetics?" 
Well, yes. 
We look at lots of code, 
written for projects that span the gamut 
from wildly successful to nearly dead. 
In doing so, 
we have learned to look for certain 
structures in the code that suggest 
(sometimes they scream for) the possibility of refactoring. 
(We are switching over to "we" 
in this chapter to reflect the fact 
that Kent and I wrote this chapter jointly.
You can tell the difference because the funny jokes are mine
and the others are his.)
