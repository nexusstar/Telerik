/*
 * In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), 
 * sometimes also called an ordered or sorted binary tree,
 * is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
 *
 *   - > The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 *   - > The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 *   - > The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
 *   - > There must be no duplicate nodes.
